      <p>Q: Why should I register as an organ and tissue donor?</p>
      <p>A: By registering you give hope to the thousands of Ontarians waiting for a transplant. Transplants not only save lives, they return recipients to productive lives.</p>
      <p>Q: Does my age, medical condition, or sexual orientation prevent me from being a donor?</p>
      <p>A: Everyone is a potential donor regardless of age, medical condition or sexual orientation. All potential donors are evaluated on an individual, medical, case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>Q: At what age am I eligible to register as an organ donor?</p>
      <p>A: Anyone 16 years or older, with a valid Ontario health card, can register their consent for tissue and organ donation.</p>
